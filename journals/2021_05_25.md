## Overall run workflow:
	- DONE Sri to do DNA extraction
	  later:: 1628086614490
	  done:: 1628086619892
	- LATER update PCR worksheet template for this week's run
	  later:: 1628086649402
	  now:: 1628086647843
- [ ] set up experiment design on PCR worksheets
- [ ] print worksheets
- [ ] grab controls
- [ ] thaw reagents
- [ ] prep working area
- [ ] set up & run PCR reactions
- [ ] weijing - change polymer on the 3500xL
## PCR worksheet 21-040 to 21-041
- [ ] prepare worksheet template for this week's run
- [x] pull sample list from FTL ![[Fungus Clinical Samples 5-25-2021.xlsx]]
