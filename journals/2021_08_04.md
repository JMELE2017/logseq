# 21-063 to 21-064 workup for Sanger sequencing

Strange is the night where black stars rise,
And strange moons circle through the skies,
But stranger still is
Lost Carcosa.

- ## benchwork:
	- [x] check for materials needed for 313D
	- [x] check calculations for reactions
	- [x]  prep area and hood for work
	- [x]  thaw primers
	- [x]  pull pcr reactions
	- [x]  set up exosap reactions (5uL reaction + 2uL exosap)
		- [x]  reactions on thermocycler
		- [x]  pull reactions and dilute.
## set up exosap reactions

## Sanger reactions on thermocycler
- [x]  21-063
- [x] 21-064
- [x] 21-065
## 21-063 to 21-065 3500xL reagents
- set up plate records & check 3500xL reagents
- [x]  21-063
- [x] 21-064
- [ ] 21-065
- ## 3500xL maintenance
- [x] JM to replenish pop7 - warm to room temp before installing.
- [x] transfer newly received (approx. 07-01-21) pop7 pockets for the 3500xL from 313C to 313D. Store at 4C
- ## 21-063 to 21-065 edgebio purification of Sanger reactions
- [x]  prep edgebio plates
- [x]  load Sanger reactions
- [x]  spin & use eluate on 3500xL
- ## load n' go
